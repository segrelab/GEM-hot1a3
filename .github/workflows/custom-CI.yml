# Controls when the workflow will run
# Run for pushes and pulls on every branch and manually from the Actions tab

# Just keep the button in the Actions tab for now, we can use the above to add all the triggers later

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # First job builds the environment
